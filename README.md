## Purpose and Scope
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ProductSearch Android application, a mobile app that enables users to search for products using an external API service. The application demonstrates modern Android development practices including clean architecture, MVVM pattern, and dependency injection.

This overview covers the high-level architecture, key components, and technologies used throughout the application. For detailed information about specific architectural layers, see Application Architecture. For build configuration details, see Build System. For user interface implementation, see User Interface.

## Application Architecture
The ProductSearch application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns across three main layers:

## Application Entry Point
The application is configured as a Hilt Android application with the following structure:

Application Class: SearchProduct annotated with @HiltAndroidApp serves as the dependency injection container
Main Activity: MainActivity handles user interactions and coordinates the search functionality
Permissions: Requires INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions for API communication

## Key Features Overview
The ProductSearch application implements the following core requirements:

## Product Search: 
Users can enter text queries to search for products via the external Walmart API
## Results Display: 
Search results show product title, price, and thumbnail image in a scrollable list
## Search History: 
Previous search terms are persisted locally and survive app restarts
## Responsive UI:
Non-blocking interface ensures smooth user experience during API calls
## Modern Architecture: 
Clean separation of concerns with testable components
